# Synapse

Synapse is an intelligent note-taking and project management application designed for neurodivergent minds. It transforms scattered thoughts into organized action by leveraging a suite of AI-powered agents. Its standout feature is the **"Neurodivergent Superpowers Visualization,"** which provides a real-time dashboard showing how the system turns context-switching into an accelerated source of project completion.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Brain Dump Interface**: Distraction-free input for docs, ideas, and random thoughts.
- **Multi-Framework Views**: The same data is displayed through 5+ different methodology lenses (Agile, Kanban, GTD, PARA, Custom).
- **Energy-State Adaptation**: The UI adapts based on detected focus levels.
- **Vector Semantic Search**: AI-powered similarity matching to find related thoughts and ideas.
- **âœ¨ Neurodivergent Superpowers Visualization**: A real-time dashboard that visually demonstrates how context-switching accelerates progress across multiple projects, turning a common challenge into a celebrated strength.
- **Progress Orchestration**: Cross-project momentum tracking and cascading updates.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns and adapts to individual neurodivergent workflow patterns.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL database (TiDB Serverless recommended)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd synapse
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your database and OpenAI credentials.

4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Testing

The project includes both end-to-end (E2E) and performance benchmark tests to ensure reliability and speed.

1.  **E2E Tests**: Validate the `/api/brain-dump` endpoint.
    - **Prerequisite**: Ensure the development server is running.
    - **Command**: `npm test server/tests/e2e/brainDump.test.ts`

2.  **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure the processing time of the core agent factory.
    - **Command**: `npm test server/lib/performance/AgentBenchmark.ts`

## ðŸ¤– Core Agent Architecture

The backend is powered by a **Vector-Enhanced Agent System**. This dynamic, modular architecture uses AI to understand the semantic meaning of your tasks.

- **`AgentFactory`**: The central coordinator that dynamically routes tasks to the most appropriate agents.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Automatically generated for all inputs, enabling semantic search and context-aware analysis.
- **Specialized Agents**: A suite of agents (`Agile`, `Kanban`, `GTD`, etc.) that apply different productivity frameworks. They are now context-aware, using historical data to make smarter recommendations.
- **`ProgressOrchestrator`**: Analyzes outputs to find cross-project momentum opportunities and quantifies the progress gain from semantically related tasks.
