# Synapse

Synapse is an intelligent note-taking and project management application designed for neurodivergent minds. It transforms scattered thoughts into organized action by leveraging a suite of AI-powered agents. Its standout feature is the **"Neurodivergent Superpowers Visualization,"** which provides a real-time dashboard showing how the system turns context-switching into an accelerated source of project completion.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Brain Dump Interface**: Distraction-free input for docs, ideas, and random thoughts.
- **Multi-Framework Views**: The same data is displayed through 5+ different methodology lenses (Agile, Kanban, GTD, PARA, Custom).
- **Energy-State Adaptation**: The UI adapts based on detected focus levels.
- **Vector Semantic Search**: AI-powered similarity matching to find related thoughts and ideas.
- **âœ¨ Neurodivergent Superpowers Visualization**: A real-time dashboard that visually demonstrates how context-switching accelerates progress across multiple projects, turning a common challenge into a celebrated strength.
- **Progress Orchestration**: Cross-project momentum tracking and cascading updates.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns and adapts to individual neurodivergent workflow patterns.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL database (TiDB Serverless recommended)
- OpenAI API key
- Docker

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd synapse
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your database and OpenAI credentials.

4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## ðŸ“‚ File Processing with `unstructured`

To enable file processing capabilities (e.g., uploading PDFs, Word documents, and images), the application uses a self-hosted instance of the open-source [`unstructured`](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) API. You will need to have Docker installed to run it.

### Running the `unstructured` API

1.  **Install Docker**: If you don't have Docker installed, follow the official instructions for your operating system: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2.  **Run the `unstructured` container**: Open your terminal and run the following command to start the API server:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8002:8000 -d --name unstructured-api quay.io/unstructured-io/unstructured-api:latest --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
    ```

    This command does the following:
    *   `docker run`: Starts a new Docker container.
    *   `-p 8002:8000`: Maps port `8002` on your local machine to port `8000` inside the container. The application is configured to connect to port `8002`.
    *   `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    *   `--name unstructured-api`: Assigns a name to the container for easy reference.
    *   `quay.io/unstructured-io/unstructured-api:latest`: Specifies the official `unstructured` API image.
    *   `--port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0`: Configures the API server inside the container to listen on all network interfaces.

Once the container is running, the application will be able to connect to it and process files.

## ðŸ¤– Core Agent Architecture

The backend is powered by a **Vector-Enhanced Agent System**. This dynamic, modular architecture uses AI to understand the semantic meaning of your tasks.

- **`AgentFactory`**: The central coordinator that dynamically routes tasks to the most appropriate agents.
- **`Prompt Warehouse`**: A centralized, database-driven repository for all agent prompts. This allows for dynamic updates, versioning, and management of prompts without requiring code changes, making the agents more flexible and easier to maintain.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Automatically generated for all inputs, enabling semantic search and context-aware analysis.
- **Specialized Agents**: A suite of agents (`Agile`, `Kanban`, `GTD`, etc.) that apply different productivity frameworks. They are now context-aware, using historical data to make smarter recommendations.
- **`ProgressOrchestrator`**: Analyzes outputs to find cross-project momentum opportunities and quantifies the progress gain from semantically related tasks.
