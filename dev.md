# Development Roadmap & Technical Documentation

This document outlines the current state of the Synapse project, its architecture, and future development plans. For a general overview, see `README.md`.

## ðŸš§ Current Status: Vector-Enhanced Agent System Complete

The initial backend architecture has been significantly refactored and enhanced into a modular, scalable, and context-aware multi-agent system. This new structure provides a solid foundation for the advanced vector-based features outlined in the roadmap below.

### Key Achievements

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: The core logic is now managed by a central `AgentFactory` that coordinates multiple specialized agents (`AgileAgent`, `KanbanAgent`, `GTDAgent`).
- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: The project includes robust E2E and performance benchmark tests to ensure API reliability and speed.
- **Self-Contained Modules**: Each component is fully self-contained, improving code clarity and maintainability.
- **Vector-Powered Intelligence**: The system now leverages vector embeddings to understand the semantic meaning of tasks, enabling intelligent framework selection and context-aware recommendations.

## ðŸš€ Completed Roadmap: The Vector-Enhanced Agent System

The following phases have been completed, transforming Synapse into a proactive and intelligent productivity assistant.

### Phase 1: Foundational Agents
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: Implemented a full suite of specialized agents (`Agile`, `Kanban`, `GTD`, `PARA`, `Custom`), each providing a unique analytical perspective on user input.

### Phase 2: Auto-Embedding Integration
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: The system now automatically converts every user input into a vector embedding using a background process and stores it in a `task_embeddings` table. This provides the semantic foundation for all subsequent intelligent features.

### Phase 3: Semantic Framework Selection
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: A new `SemanticAgent` was introduced to analyze the vector embedding of a new user input. It performs a similarity search against past tasks to find semantically related work and recommends the most effective frameworks based on historical patterns.

### Phase 4: Dynamic Agent Routing
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: The `AgentFactory` was upgraded to be a dynamic router. Instead of running all agents every time, it now selectively executes only the agents recommended by the `SemanticAgent`, improving efficiency and relevance. The `ProgressOrchestrator` was also made more resilient to handle this dynamic pipeline.

### Phase 5: Context-Aware Agent Parameters
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: The agents are now context-aware. The `AgentFactory` enriches the `UserContext` with the `similarPastTasks` identified by the `SemanticAgent`. This historical data is passed to the framework agents, allowing them to make more informed and personalized decisions (e.g., the `GTDAgent` can now identify recurring patterns in how similar tasks were previously handled).

### Phase 6: Killer Demo Feature - "Neurodivergent Superpowers Visualization"
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: To showcase the system's unique value, a real-time visualization was implemented to demonstrate how context-switching can be a strength. This feature turns a perceived "weakness" into a tangible "superpower."
- **Backend (`ProgressOrchestrator.ts`)**: The `CrossProjectRelation` interface was enhanced with a `progressGain` metric. This quantifies the percentage of progress made on a related task when a semantically similar task is completed. The calculation is based on the number of related tasks and the strength of the semantic link.
- **Frontend (`ProgressRippleViz.tsx`)**: A new, dedicated React component was created to animate and display these "progress ripples." It takes the initial user input and the `crossProjectImpacts` from the API and renders a cascading visualization of how one action creates a wave of progress across the system.
- **Integration (`Home.tsx`)**: The `ProgressRippleViz` component was integrated into the main application page. It is conditionally rendered whenever the API response contains `crossProjectImpacts`, providing immediate, powerful visual feedback that demonstrates the core value proposition of the Synapse system.

### Phase 7: Tier-Based Agent Gating
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: Implemented a tier-based access control system for AI agents to support different pricing plans.
- **Backend (`database/schema.sql`)**: Added a `pricing_tiers` table and updated the `user_profiles` table to include a `tier_id`. This allows for different levels of access and features based on the user's subscription.
- **Backend (`shared/schema.ts`)**: Updated the Drizzle schemas to reflect the database changes, including the new `tier` property on the `users` table.
- **Backend (`server/lib/AgentFactory.ts`)**: Modified the `AgentFactory` to read the user's tier from the `UserContext` and dynamically gate access to agents based on the permissions defined in `TIER_AGENT_ACCESS`. This ensures that users only have access to the agents included in their pricing plan.

### Phase 8: File-Based Brain Dumps with `unstructured.io`
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: To expand the input capabilities beyond plain text, the application now supports file uploads. Users can submit documents (PDF, DOCX), images, and other file types, and the system will extract the text content for processing. This was achieved by integrating the `unstructured.io` library.
- **Initial Implementation (Cloud API)**: The feature was first built using the `unstructured.io` cloud API. This involved creating an `unstructuredService` to handle API requests with an API key.
- **Final Implementation (Open-Source & Self-Hosted)**: To prioritize data privacy and eliminate external dependencies, the service was reconfigured to use a local, self-hosted `unstructured` API instance running in a Docker container.
- **Backend (`server/routes.ts`)**: A new endpoint, `/api/brain-dump/file`, was created to handle `multipart/form-data` requests. It uses `multer` to process the file upload before passing it to the `unstructuredService`.
- **Backend (`server/lib/unstructuredService.ts`)**: This new service encapsulates the logic for interacting with the `unstructured` API. It was updated to point to the local Docker container (`http://localhost:8002`) and no longer requires an API key.
- **Frontend (`client/src/components/BrainDumpInterface.tsx`)**: The brain dump component was enhanced with a file input, allowing users to select and attach a file. The UI was designed to handle either text input or a file upload, but not both simultaneously.
- **Frontend (`client/src/pages/Home.tsx`)**: The main page was updated with a new handler function (`handleFileSubmit`) to manage the file upload process, sending the file to the new backend endpoint.
- **Documentation (`README.md`)**: The project's `README` was updated with detailed instructions on how to install Docker and run the `unstructured` API container, ensuring a smooth setup process for future developers.

### Phase 9: Prompt Warehouse for Agent Flexibility
- **Status**: âœ… Complete
- **Description**: To make the agent prompts more manageable, versionable, and dynamically updatable without code changes, a `prompt_warehouse` was implemented. This feature centralizes all agent-related prompts in the database.
- **Backend (`database/schema.sql`)**: A `prompt_warehouse` table was added to store prompts, including `prompt_name`, `prompt_text`, `agent_type`, and `version`.
- **Backend (`shared/schema.ts`)**: The Drizzle schema was updated to include `promptWarehouse`.
- **Backend (`prompts/agent_prompts.md`)**: A markdown file was created to serve as a source of truth for initial prompt seeding.
- **Backend (`server/lib/prompt-warehouse-service.ts`)**: A new service was created to manage fetching prompts from the database, caching them for performance, and seeding the database from the `agent_prompts.md` file on startup.
- **Backend (`server/index.ts`)**: The server's main entry point was updated to call the `seedPrompts` function in development, ensuring the database is always populated with the latest prompts.
- **Backend (`server/lib/agents/AgileAgent.ts`)**: The `AgileAgent` was refactored to fetch its prompt from the `PromptWarehouseService` instead of using a hardcoded string. An `initialize` method was added to pre-fetch the prompt on startup.
